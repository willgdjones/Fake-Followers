Fake-Followers
==============

Chrome Extension to show percentage of Fake Followers, next to the follower count on a twitter profile.

Uses Twitteraudit.com for the analysis, big thank you to them.	

Just load the folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome and see for yourself.

Comments:

If an account hasn't been audited yet, you'll see a sad face. You need to visit TwitterAudit.com and run an audit manually. Once you've done this however, the percentage will be displayed for you every time (and for all of us!)

If for some reason the loading screen doesn't appear, reload the page.

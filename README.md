Fake-Followers
==============

Chrome Extension to show percentage of Fake Followers, next to the follower count on a twitter profile.

Uses Twitteraudit.com for the analysis, thank you 	

Just load the folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome and see for yourself.

Lots of things to work on:
	- If an account hasn't been audited yet, it outputs a big UNDEFINED
	- You need to autherize TwitterAudit to your twitter account, and be logged in to both Twitter and Twitter Audit for it to work.
	- Would be nice to have a spinning wheel when the audit is loading.
